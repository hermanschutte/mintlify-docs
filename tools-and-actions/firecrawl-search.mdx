The **Firecrawl: Search** action enables your AI support agent to search the web using [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) and optionally scrape full page content from search results. This allows your chatbot to look up the latest and most relevant information for visitor queries.

## How it Works

When a visitor asks a question that your chatbot can't answer from its training data, it will use Firecrawl to search the web, retrieve relevant results, and optionally scrape the full content of those pages to provide a comprehensive answer.

## Add a Firecrawl: Search Action

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Tools & Actions">
    In your chatbot dashboard, click **Configuration** in the sidebar, then select **Tools & Actions**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Action">
    Click the **+ Add Action** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search for Firecrawl">
    Type "Firecrawl" in the search field to filter the available actions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Firecrawl: Search">

### Configure the Action

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Name and Description">
    - **Name**: Give your action a descriptive name (e.g., `firecrawl_search`)
    - **Description**: Describe when the AI should use this action. The default is: "Use this action when the user asks about a topic or question that you do not know the answer to. Use the search query supplied by the user to search the web for information and use the results to answer the question."
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter API Key">
    Enter your **Firecrawl API key**. Get one from [https://firecrawl.dev](https://firecrawl.dev).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Search Options">
    - **Limit**: Number of search results to return (1-500). Default is 5.
    - **Sources**: Select which sources to search (e.g., "Web").
    - **Location**: Geographic location for search results (e.g., "Germany", "San Francisco, California, United States"). Leave blank for global search.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Scrape Content (Optional)">
    Toggle **Scrape Content** to scrape full page content from search results. This provides more detailed information but uses more Firecrawl credits.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Action">
    Click the **Add Action** button to save and enable the action.
  </Step>
</Steps>
