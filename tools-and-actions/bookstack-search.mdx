The **BookStack: Search Wiki** action allows your AI support agent to search and retrieve information directly from your BookStack wiki. This enables real-time lookups when answering visitor questions.

<Note>
  Adding the [BookStack training integration](/training-your-chatbot/bookstack) is still the preferred option for training your agent on your BookStack content since this results in faster responses from your agent. Use this action when you need real-time search capabilities.
</Note>

## How it Works

When a user asks a question that might be answered by your BookStack wiki, the chatbot will search your wiki in real-time, retrieve relevant content, and use it to formulate an accurate response.

    In your chatbot dashboard, click **Configuration** in the sidebar, then select **Tools & Actions**.

### Configure BookStack Credentials

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Name and Description">
    - **Name**: Give your action a descriptive name (e.g., `search_bookstack_wiki`)
    - **Description**: Describe when the AI should use this action (e.g., "Use this action to search and retrieve information from a Bookstack wiki to answer questions from visitors.")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Wiki URL">
    Enter the base URL of your BookStack installation (e.g., `https://wiki.mywebsite.com`).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Get API Credentials from BookStack">
    1. Log in to your BookStack wiki as an admin.
    2. Go to your user profile settings.
    3. Navigate to the **API Tokens** section.
    4. Create a new API token.
    5. Copy the **Token ID** (Access Token) and **Token Secret**.
    
    For more details, see the [BookStack API documentation](https://demo.bookstackapp.com/api/docs).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Access Token and Token Secret">
    Paste your **Access Token** and **Token Secret** into the respective fields.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Action">
    Click the **Add Action** button to save and enable the action.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Make sure the API user has the **Access System API** and **Export content** permissions enabled on one of their assigned roles. This ensures SiteSpeakAI can retrieve information from your BookStack wiki.

## When to Use This Action vs Training Integration

| Feature | BookStack Training | BookStack: Search Wiki Action |
|---------|-------------------|------------------------------|
| Response speed | Faster | Slightly slower (real-time search) |
| Content freshness | Syncs hourly | Always current |
| Best for | Static documentation | Frequently updated wikis |

If your wiki content changes frequently and you need the absolute latest information in responses, use this action. For most use cases, the [training integration](/training-your-chatbot/bookstack) is recommended.
