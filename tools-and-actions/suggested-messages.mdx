## Configuration

</Frame>

### Name (required)

A descriptive name for the action. Make this specific to help your AI agent know exactly when to use it.

**Example:** `login_issues` or `order_issues`

### Description (required)

A description of the action and when it should be used. Be specific about the context and how the agent should respond.

**Example:**
> Use this action when the user asks about issues with their order. Be helpful and friendly and suggest some follow up responses for them.

<Tip>
  Make the **Name** and **Description** as specific as possible to help your AI agent know exactly when to use this action and what kind of follow-up messages to suggest.
</Tip>

### Enable Auto Suggested Messages (required)

This option is **enabled by default** and allows the agent to automatically generate up to 4 suggested follow-up messages based on the conversation.

If you'd like to specify your own messages instead:
1. Disable this option
2. Add a comma-separated list of messages to use

## Save the Action

Click **Add Action** to enable the action for your AI agent.

When your visitors mention topics related to your suggested message action, your agent will display follow-up response options for them to click.

---

## How It Works

Once enabled, when a visitor asks about a topic matching your action's description, the chatbot will display clickable suggested messages. This helps guide the conversation and makes it easier for visitors to get the information they need.

**Example scenario:**

If a visitor asks "I'm having trouble logging in", and you have a `login_issues` action configured, your chatbot might suggest:
- "I forgot my password"
- "My account is locked"
- "I'm not receiving the verification email"
- "I need to update my email address"
