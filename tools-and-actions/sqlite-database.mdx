### Description (required)

A description of the action and when it should be used.

**Example:** `Use this action when the user asks about assessment score results.`

<Note>
  Make sure the **Name** and **Description** are descriptive so that the agent will know exactly when to use this action.
</Note>

### Database (required)

## Save the Action

Click the **Add Action** button to add and enable the action for your chatbot.

Your chatbot can now use this action to "chat to your database" and retrieve information to answer your visitors' questions.

## Example Use Case

Using the Chinook DB (a sample music store database), your chatbot can answer questions like:

- "What albums do you have by Led Zeppelin?"
- "How many tracks are in the Rock genre?"
- "What are the top selling artists?"

The AI agent will automatically generate the appropriate SQL queries to retrieve the information from your database.
