You want to embed your custom trained AI support agent in your **b2evolution** website page. Here's how to add an AI support agent to b2evolution with SiteSpeakAI.

**What is b2evolution?**

b2evolution is a content management system (CMS) - basically, a tool for building and managing websites. It's a bit different from popular platforms like WordPress or Wix. Instead of relying heavily on themes and plugins, b2evolution is built around a unique "document-centric" approach. Think of it like this: you create individual "documents" (articles, pages, etc.) and then organize them into categories and sections. It's known for being very flexible and powerful, allowing for a lot of customization without needing to code. It's also quite robust and reliable, often praised for its stability.

**Who is it best suited for?**

b2evolution is a good choice for:

* **Individuals or small teams** who want a powerful and customizable CMS without relying on large plugin ecosystems.
* **Websites that require a high degree of control** over their design and functionality.
* **Bloggers and writers** who appreciate a structured approach to content creation.
* **Those comfortable with a slightly steeper learning curve** than some simpler CMS platforms. It's not as drag-and-drop as WordPress.
