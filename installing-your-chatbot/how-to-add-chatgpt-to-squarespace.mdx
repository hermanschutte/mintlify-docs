Your chatbot is now live on your Squarespace website.

## Adding chatbot to specific pages only

If you want the chatbot to appear only on certain pages instead of your entire site:

1. In Squarespace, go to the specific page where you want the chatbot
2. Click the gear icon to open **Page Settings**
3. Select the **Advanced** tab
4. Paste your code snippet in the **Page Header Code Injection** field
5. Click **Save**

This method lets you add the chatbot to individual pages without affecting your whole site.

## Troubleshooting

**Chatbot not appearing?** Make sure you clicked **Save** after adding your code, then refresh your website. It may take a moment for changes to appear.

**Style conflicts with your theme?** The chatbot widget is designed to work with all Squarespace templates. If you notice any visual issues, try adjusting the chatbot position in your SiteSpeakAI dashboard settings.

**Chatbot position overlapping with elements?** You can customize the chatbot's position (bottom-left, bottom-right) and offset in your SiteSpeakAI appearance settings to avoid overlapping with Squarespace elements like sticky footers or cookie banners.

**Code Injection option not available?** You'll need a Squarespace Business or Commerce plan to use Code Injection. Check your plan settings to confirm.
