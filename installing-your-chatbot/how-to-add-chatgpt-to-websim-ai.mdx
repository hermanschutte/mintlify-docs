You want to embed your custom trained AI support agent in your **Websim AI** website page. Here's how to add an AI support agent to Websim AI with SiteSpeakAI.

The **Websim AI** platform allows you to create entire websites, games, or even marketplaces using simple AI prompts. It brings your creative ideas to life, whether it's a neon-colored marketing toolbox or a real-time AI news website. The platform's ability to generate dynamic websites with fresh content makes it perfect for educators or marketers looking to increase user engagement.

For this tutorial we are only going to look at adding Custom HTML to an existing website created with Websim AI. The creation of the website (using the AI prompts/command line) is not part of this tutorial, you can refer to the link below to display the Websim AI website for further info).

**Note**: We have used **gpt-5.1** to set up the website for this tutorial.
