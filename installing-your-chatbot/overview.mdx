SiteSpeakAI can be installed on virtually any website or platform. Choose your platform below to get step-by-step installation instructions.

## Quick Install (Any Website)

The fastest way to add your chatbot to any website is with our embed script. Simply add this code to your website's HTML:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
  (function(){
    d=document;
    s=d.createElement("script");
    s.src="https://sitespeak.ai/chatbots/YOUR_CHATBOT_ID.js";
    s.async=1;
    d.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(s);
  })();
</script>
```

Replace `YOUR_CHATBOT_ID` with your actual chatbot ID, which you can find in your [dashboard](https://sitespeak.ai/dashboard) under **Install Agent**.
