You want to embed your custom trained chatbot in your **Marcom Robot** website page. Here's how to add ChatGPT to Marcom Robot with SiteSpeakAI.

**Marcom Robot** is a website builder that's designed to be incredibly easy to use, even if you have absolutely no experience with coding or website design. It uses a unique "chatbot" interface where you basically talk to the robot (Marcom) and tell it what you want your website to look like and do, and it builds it for you automatically. It generates clean, responsive websites based on your answers.
