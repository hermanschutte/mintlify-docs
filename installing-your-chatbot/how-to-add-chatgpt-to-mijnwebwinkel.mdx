You want to embed your custom trained AI support agent in your **Mijnwebwinkel** webstore page. Here's how to add an AI support agent to Mijnwebwinkel with SiteSpeakAI.

**Mijnwebwinkel** is a relatively simple and affordable e-commerce platform. It's designed to be easy for small businesses and entrepreneurs to quickly set up and run an online store without needing extensive technical skills. It focuses on providing the core features you need to sell products online – like product listings, shopping carts, payment processing, and order management – all in a user-friendly interface.  It's particularly strong for selling physical products.

## Add your AI support agent to your **Mijnwebwinkel** website

### In SiteSpeakAI

Log into your SiteSpeakAI account and select your agent from the dropdown menu at the top, click on the **Install Agent** section in the sidebar, select the **Javascript** tab and then click on the **Copy Code** button to copy your agent code snippet.

### In Mijnwebwinkel

To add Custom HTML to your webstore (e.g., your AI support agent JS snippet as copied above), it is necessary that you have connected **Google Tag Manager** (GTM) - this is available from a Mijnwebwinkel PRO subscription. 

If you have not yet done so, read via the link below how to create a Google Tag Manager account and how you can link it in the management environment of your webstore. Do this before continuing with SiteSpeakAI.

[Information about Google Tag Manager and creating an account](https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/tag-manager/)

A. **How do I integrate Google Tag Manager?**

With Google Tag Manager you place HTML tags on your website, e.g., to integrate a live chat. Google already has a number of frequently used tags ready for you, so you can place them in your shop in no time.

For displaying your SiteSpeakAI custom ChatGPT trained AI support agent on your store pages you will have to create a custom tag. How to link GTM to your store is explained below. We will then show you how to create the tag you need (it will need some technical knowledge from your side, but if you follow what we show you, it shouldn't be too difficult!).

**Please note!** Tags that you apply could influence the way your web store works. It is therefore important that you regularly check the functioning of your shop and order process. 

Furthermore, please note that the SiteSpeakAI support team does not offer support in creating tags. 

Now it's time to get started with Google Tag Manager.

B. **Create a Google Tag Manager account**

1. Go to Google Tag Manager and sign in with your Google account. Start with creating an account and a container. This container is what you will later link to your shop and contains your tag. Fill in the following information:
   
   - Under **Account Setup**, fill in your **Account Name**. This is mandatory, you can use the name of your company or shop.
   - Select your **Country** if necessary.
   - You can select sharing your data with Google and others (see info regarding this in popup).
   - Under **Container Setup**, enter the shop domain name at **Container name**.
   - As the Target platform, select the **Web** option.

2. Click on **Create**.

3. The Google Tag Manager Terms of Service Agreement will now be displayed. If you do agree to the terms stated therein, tick the checkbox at the bottom of the Service Agreement page and click on **Yes** at the top of the page.

4. A piece of code will now appear on the screen. You don't have to place this in your webstore, just leave that to us! That will be fully automated once you have completed this instruction.

C. **Linking your container**

1. On your Mijnwebwinkel Dashboard, select **Marketing** on the left menu bar and click on **Google services**.

D. **Adding your tag**

That wasn't too bad, was it? Time to start filling your container! Besides the ready-made tags that Google already has in there, you can also create your own HTML tags. This option is used for example to add a live chat on every page of your store, or for showing Google Maps on your contact page. For SiteSpeakAI it will be used to display your chatbot on your Mijnwebwinkel store pages.

1. Make sure you're logged into **Google Tag Manager** account and select the container you've linked to your store. Select **Tags** in the menu on the left sidebar and click on **New** to create a new tag.
