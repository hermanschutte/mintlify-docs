Adding a custom trained AI chatbot to your Wix website enables you to provide instant customer support, answer common questions, and capture leads around the clock.

<Warning>
Adding custom code to your Wix website requires a **Premium plan**. Your site must also be published and connected to a domain for the chatbot to appear on your live site.
</Warning>

## Add your chatbot to your Wix website

4. Paste your chatbot code snippet into the **Add Custom Code** modal
   - Give it a name like "SiteSpeakAI Chatbot" to identify it easily
   - Choose whether to display on **All pages** or a specific page

5. Click **Apply** to save your changes

<Note>
The chatbot will only appear on your published site, not in the Wix Editor preview. You must publish your changes to see the chatbot.
</Note>

7. Your chatbot button will now appear on your live website

## Alternative: Using an HTML embed

If you prefer to embed the chatbot in a specific location on your page rather than as a floating widget:

1. In the Wix Editor, click **Add Elements** > **Embed Code** > **Embed HTML**
2. Drag the HTML widget to where you want the chatbot to appear
3. Click **Enter Code** and paste the iFrame embed code from SiteSpeakAI
4. Resize the embed box as needed
5. Publish your site

This method is useful if you want the chatbot to appear inline within your page content rather than as a floating button.

## Mobile responsiveness

The SiteSpeakAI chatbot widget is fully responsive and works on all devices. On mobile, the chat button automatically adjusts its position to avoid interfering with navigation elements. You can customize the mobile position offset in your SiteSpeakAI dashboard if needed.

## Troubleshooting

**Chatbot not appearing after publishing?** Clear your browser cache and reload the page. Wix may cache your site for performance.

**Custom Code option not available?** Make sure you have a Wix Premium plan. Custom code features are not available on free Wix sites.

**Chatbot appears in wrong position?** Adjust the position and offset settings in your SiteSpeakAI appearance settings. You can position the widget in any corner and set custom margins.

**Preview not showing the chatbot?** This is expected behavior. Wix's preview mode doesn't load custom code. You must publish your site to see the chatbot.
