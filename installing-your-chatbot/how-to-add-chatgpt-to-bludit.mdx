You want to embed your custom trained AI support agent in your **bludit** website page. Here's how to add an AI support agent to bludit with SiteSpeakAI.

**Bludit** is a *free, open-source website builder*. Think of it like WordPress, but you download the software and install it on your own web hosting account instead of using WordPress.com. It's built around a simple, drag-and-drop interface, making it easy to create visually appealing websites without needing to code. It uses Markdown for content formatting, which is a lightweight way to write text.

**Website URL:** [https://bludit.com/](https://bludit.com/)

### In SiteSpeakAI

Log into your SiteSpeakAI account and select your agent from the dropdown menu at the top, click on the **Install Agent** section in the sidebar, select the **Javascript** tab and then click on the **Copy Code** button to copy your agent code snippet.
