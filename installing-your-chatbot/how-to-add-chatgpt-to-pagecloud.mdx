You want to embed your custom trained AI support agent in your **Pagecloud** website page. Here's how to add an AI support agent to Pagecloud with SiteSpeakAI.

**Pagecloud** is a website builder that's *really* focused on helping businesses quickly create professional-looking websites, especially those with complex needs like booking systems, membership areas, and online stores. It's different from typical drag-and-drop builders like Wix or Squarespace because it's built on top of WordPress, giving you a lot more flexibility and control *without* needing to be a coding expert. Think of it as a simplified, guided way to use the power of WordPress.
