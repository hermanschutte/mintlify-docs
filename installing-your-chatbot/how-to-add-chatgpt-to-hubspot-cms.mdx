You want to embed your custom trained AI support agent in your **Hubspot CMS** website page. Here's how to add an AI support agent to Hubspot CMS with SiteSpeakAI.

**HubSpot CMS** is a content management system (CMS) built directly into the HubSpot Marketing Hub and CRM. It allows marketers and businesses to create and manage website content, including pages, blog posts, and landing pages, without needing to rely on external platforms like WordPress. It's tightly integrated with HubSpot's other tools (email marketing, forms, sales, etc.), enabling a seamless workflow for content creation, personalization, and lead generation.  It's known for its ease of use, drag-and-drop interface, and focus on marketing automation.
