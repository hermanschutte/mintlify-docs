**Please note**: We are going to add your AI support agent snippet to your website by means of editing one of the code files. The file we are going to edit is the **index.html** which we all know is quite an important file and could mess up your website if care is no taken properly during editing. This is not for the fainthearted so you will have to be careful when editing these files. In our case we are only going to edit the **index.html** file and insert the chatbot snippet just below the closing `</body>` tag. We suggest you make a backup of the index.html file before you make any changes to the file. You can do this by copying the index.html file contents and saving it to an offline file on your computer. If something goes wrong you can then just replace the ***messed up*** contents with the original.

3. Select the index.html file, Insert your snippet just below the `</body>` tag and click on **Save**
