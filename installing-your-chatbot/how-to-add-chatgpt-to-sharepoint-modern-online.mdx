You want to embed your custom trained chatbot in your **SharePoint Modern Online** website page. Here's how to add ChatGPT to SharePoint Modern Online with SiteSpeakAI.

## Add your chatbot To your **SharePoint Modern Online** website

SharePoint doesn't allow adding custom HTML as other website builders do. You can use Microsoft Copilot Studio to create a webpart but we found a **Power Popups** app that will do the job for us. This popup can be triggered by clicking on a button, a link or an image. **Power Popups** offer a 7 day free full function option which allows you to test the functionality.

Due to the fact that we have no access to the header and footer code of the website, the popup can not be added to display site wide, you must add the popup to each page of your website.

In this tutorial we will look at an image as a trigger. The button is similar but can only contain text on it so you can put any relevant text on it. The image will be displayed with a minimum size of 100x100px. You can play around with the size. The popup trigger will be added to a section. Sections can have different layouts, i.e. 1, 2 or 3 columns but we suggest a 3 column layout so you can basically add the popup trigger left, center or right.

### In SiteSpeakAI

Select your chatbot from the dropdown menu at the top, click on the **Install Chatbot** section in the sidebar and select the **iFrame** option. Then select and copy the iframe source URL. This will be used as the URL for the iFrame being displayed in the popup.
