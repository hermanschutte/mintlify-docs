You want to embed your custom trained AI support agent in your **Moodle** LMS website page. Here's how to add an AI support agent to Moodle with SiteSpeakAI.

**Moodle** (pronounced "mood-ull") is a free and open-source **online learning platform**. Think of it like a virtual classroom. It's used by schools, universities, businesses, and even individuals to create and deliver online courses, training programs, and learning materials. 

It allows instructors to:

*   **Upload materials:** Share documents, videos, presentations, etc.
*   **Create assignments:**  Set quizzes, tests, and projects.
*   **Facilitate discussions:**  Provide forums for students to interact.
*   **Track progress:** Monitor student performance.

It's very customizable and can be adapted to fit a wide range of learning needs.
