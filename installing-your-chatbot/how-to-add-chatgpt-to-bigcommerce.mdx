You want to embed your custom trained AI support agent in your **BigCommerce** website page. Here's how to add an AI support agent to BigCommerce with SiteSpeakAI.

**BigCommerce** is a fully hosted e-commerce platform, basically, it's a website builder *specifically* designed for online stores. Unlike some other platforms (like Shopify), you don't need to find a separate web host. BigCommerce handles everything from hosting your website and processing payments to managing inventory and shipping. It's built with a focus on scalability, meaning it can grow with your business.

**Website URL:** [https://www.bigcommerce.com/](https://www.bigcommerce.com/)
