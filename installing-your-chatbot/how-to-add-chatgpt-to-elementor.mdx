You want to embed your custom trained AI support agent in your **Elementor** website page. Here's how to add an AI support agent to Elementor with SiteSpeakAI.

**Please note**: Installing **Elementor** as a plugin on **WordPress** is not part of this tutorial but you can follow the installation on [**How to Install Elementor Pro: Full Guide**](https://elementor.com/help/installing-elementor-pro/).

## Add your AI support agent to your **Elementor** website

### In SiteSpeakAI

Log into your SiteSpeakAI account and select your agent from the dropdown menu at the top, click on the **Install Agent** section in the sidebar, select the **Javascript** tab and then click on the **Copy Code** button to copy your agent code snippet.

### In Elementor

With Elementor you have two (2) options to embed your AI support agent code snippet:

- Using the **Elementor Editor** to add an **HTML** element containing your snippet per page in a selected section on your page (this option is also available if you have the **free** Elementor plugin installed)
- Using the **Elementor Code** editor to add the code snippet as a code element to your website. You can select where it should be displayed, i.e. on the entire site or per page. Note that this option is only available with the **Elementor Pro** (paid) subscription.

We will cover both options.

#### A. Using the **Elementor Editor** option

1. Log into your **WordPress** account and on the Dashboard, select **Pages → All Pages** on the leftside menu

2. Scroll down on the list of available pages until you find the page you want to add your snippet to. Move your mouse over the page entry and select **Edit with Elementor**
