You want to embed your custom trained AI support agent in your **Blogger** website page. Here's how to add an AI support agent to Blogger with SiteSpeakAI.

**What is Blogger?**

Blogger (now known as Blogger by Google) is a free, web-based blogging platform. Think of it as a really simple way to create and publish your own website or blog without needing to know a lot about coding or web design. You write posts, add pictures, and it automatically puts them on your website. Google handles all the technical stuff like hosting and security.

**Who is it best suited for?**

* **Beginners:** It's incredibly easy to use, even if you've never created a website before.
* **Personal Blogs:** Great for sharing your thoughts, hobbies, travel experiences, recipes, or anything you want to talk about.
* **Small Businesses/Simple Websites:** Can be used to create a basic online presence for a small business, portfolio, or to share news.
* **People who want a free and straightforward option:** It's completely free to use, and there are no complicated subscriptions.
