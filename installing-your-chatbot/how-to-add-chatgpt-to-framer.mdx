You want to embed your custom trained AI support agent in your **Framer** website page. Here's how to add an AI support agent to Framer with SiteSpeakAI.

**Framer** is a website builder that's different from traditional drag-and-drop platforms like Wix or Squarespace. It's essentially a **design tool for websites**. Instead of just picking pre-made templates, you build your website using **code-like components** – think of them as building blocks you can customize with CSS (the language that controls how websites look). It's incredibly powerful for creating **interactive and visually stunning websites**, especially those with complex animations, micro-interactions, and unique layouts.

### In SiteSpeakAI

Log into your SiteSpeakAI account and select your agent from the dropdown menu at the top, click on the **Install Agent** section in the sidebar, select the **Javascript** tab and then click on the **Copy Code** button to copy your agent code snippet.
