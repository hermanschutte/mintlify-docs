You want to embed your custom trained AI support agent in your **Github Pages** website page. Here's how to add an AI support agent to Github Pages with SiteSpeakAI.

**GitHub Pages** is a free service offered by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from your GitHub repositories. It's incredibly easy to use, you simply push your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to a specific branch of your repository (usually `main` or `gh-pages`), and GitHub Pages automatically builds and serves your website. It's perfect for personal portfolios, documentation sites, landing pages, and simple blogs.

**Website:** [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/)

## Add your AI support agent to your **Github Pages** website

### In SiteSpeakAI

Log into your SiteSpeakAI account and select your agent from the dropdown menu at the top, click on the **Install Agent** section in the sidebar, select the **Javascript** tab and then click on the **Copy Code** button to copy your agent code snippet.

3. On the page editor page, select **Edit this file** and then select the way you want to edit the file, i.e. **Edit in place** (This opens an editor to allow editing), **github.dev** or **Github Desktop**. For the sake of this tutorial we will use the **Edit in place** option
