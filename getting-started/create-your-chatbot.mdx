<Steps>
  <Step title="Name your bot">
    Choose a name for your chatbot. You can always change this later.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your website">
    Add your website URL or sitemap so we can crawl it for source links to train your chatbot. You can add more later or even change the links to a different site. You can also use PDFs to train your chatbot.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select your sources">
    Select the source links from your website you would like to use to train your chatbot. You can add more later.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Train your chatbot">
    Your chatbot will now be trained. This can take a minute or two depending on the number of links you selected, but should normally only take a few seconds.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test your chatbot">
    You can now test your chatbot and ask it questions about the content you used to train it.
  </Step>
</Steps>
