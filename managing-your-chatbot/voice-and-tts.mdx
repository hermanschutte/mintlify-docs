Make your chatbot more accessible by enabling speech recognition (speech-to-text) and text-to-speech capabilities.

Speech recognition allows visitors to speak their questions instead of typing. When enabled, the agent will respond with both text and audio.

  <Step title="Go to Configuration">
    In your chatbot dashboard, click **Configuration** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Settings">
    Click on **Settings**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Go to Advanced tab">
    Click on the **Advanced** tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Speech Recognition">
    Toggle on **Enable Speech Recognition**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once enabled, a microphone icon appears in the chat input field. Visitors can click it to speak their message.

## Text-to-speech

Text-to-speech allows the agent to respond with audio, reading responses aloud to visitors.

### Enable text-to-speech

In the same **Advanced** tab:

1. Toggle on **Enable Text to Speech**

Once enabled, the agent's responses will include an audio playback option.

## Speech services language

Select the language and voice you want to use for both speech recognition and text-to-speech:

1. Find the **Speech Services Language** dropdown
2. Select your preferred language and voice (e.g., "English (US, Female)")

<Note>
  If your language isn't supported, you can request it by clicking "Let us know" in the settings.
</Note>

## Use cases

Voice features are especially useful for:

- **Accessibility**: Supporting visitors who have difficulty typing
- **Mobile users**: Easier input on small screens
- **Hands-free scenarios**: When visitors can't type
- **Multilingual support**: Natural voice interaction in different languages
