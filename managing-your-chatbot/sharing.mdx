## How the Share Page Works

When someone opens your share link:

1. They see a full-page version of your chatbot
2. They can immediately start chatting without any installation
3. The chatbot uses all your configured settings, training, and appearance options
4. Conversations are logged in your dashboard like any other interaction

## Customizing the Share Experience

The share page uses your chatbot's configured settings. To customize how it appears:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Appearance" icon="paintbrush" href="/managing-your-chatbot/appearance">
    Change the name, colors, theme, and icons.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Welcome Message" icon="message-circle" href="/managing-your-chatbot/personalise-welcome-message">
    Set the greeting visitors see when they open the chat.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
